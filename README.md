# Locking App

This repository contains a very small React-based web page. When loaded in a browser it shows a white lock icon on a green background.

## Running

Any basic HTTP server can host the page. If you have Python installed, you can run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open your browser to <http://localhost:8000> and navigate to `index.html`.
